# RLGameBox
A collection of reinforcement learning games created using godot and godot-rl-agents.

Note: This project has recently switched from pygame to godot so older versions of games have been canceled.

## How to use

To use this project first create a python venv.  

Then install all requirements using:  
```pip install -r requirements.text```

Now open the game project in the godot editor (mono version) and
install the godot-rl plugin as an addon.

Now build the project using the godot editor for the wanted platform.
Which should result in the executable to play the game.

Or play the train|main scene in the editor itself and connect it using the gdrl command in a terminal.
